# ThreeJs-Scene
This project is a demonstration of abilities in ThreeJs. It is designed to show competence in placing and manipulating objects and lights in a three dimensional scene.
Overview
This project builds off of the previously completed project. The previously completed project included 6 objects in 3-dimensional space. A yellow cube, a blue cylinder, an orange torus, a red ball, a green torus knot, and a green dodecahedron. Each item has a different slider that corresponds to it, each slider has a different effect on its respective object. There are three lights in the image, a red light positioned to the left, a white light that is slightly to the right and back, and an ambient soft white light.

4 more objects have been added below the original 6 objects. One is a rectangular prism with a brick texture. Another is a metal box. Another is a representation of the earth as a globe. And the final object is a marble.

The 4 lower objects are made with MeshBasicMaterial over which the image files representing their appearance were laid. The front 3 upper objects use the MeshPhongMaterial which demonstrates the appear of the lights very well. The rear 3 upper objects are made with MeshLambertMaterial.
